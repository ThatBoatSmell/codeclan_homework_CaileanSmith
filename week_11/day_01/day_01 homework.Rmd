Difference between Classification and Clustering

Classification:

Supervised learning approach, using a testing and training dataset
Uses algorithms to categorize new data 
Goal is to find which class a new object belongs to

Example Applications:
Detection of unsolicited email
Recognition of the face
Determining whether or not a client is likely to leave
Approval of a Bank Loan

Clustering:

Unsupervised learning approach, doesn't use testing or training datasets. 
Grouping is done on a similarities basis
Uses statistical concepts where dataset is divided into subsets with the same features
Goal is to group set of objects to see if there is any relationship between them

Example Applications:
Market segmentation is based on customer preferences
An investigation of the social networks that exist
Segmentation of an image
Recommendation Engines

Logistical Regression

What is it?

Statistical method used for building machine learning models where the dependent variable is binary.
Used to describe data and the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Advantages

Less computationally intensive
Highly Interpretable
Easy to implement and train a model with

Disadvantages

It's harder to identify complex relationships compared to using other methods
More sensitive to outliers
Requires a large dataset and sufficient training examples

Suitable areas of application

In marketing, logistic regression can be used to predict if a targeted audience will respond or not
In the financial industry, logistic regression can be used to predict if a transaction is fraudulent or not
Text recognition - Can use logistical regression to train a binary classifier that can differentiate between distrinct characters
