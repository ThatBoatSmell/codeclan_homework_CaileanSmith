### Which tools were used in the project

For this project, we used:

Zoom: For stand-ups and paired/group working
and for general "work hours" communication

Slack: For discussion out of "work hours", 
to keep in contact regarding anything we 
were having issues with and general
updates

RStudio: To develop our app and code-base

Excalidraw: For designing our framework, keeping ideas
together and allowing collaborative input  

GitHub: For version control, working on our own branches and
for collaborating

Google Slides: for creating our presentation   



### How did you gather and synthesise requirements for the project?

We synthesised the information given in the brief by working through the brief and discussing what points we wanted to focus on, 
as well as looking through the datasets recommended to gain a better understanding of what direction we could go in.
We prioritised getting an "MVP" version of the app running - at every point, we made sure that we were not straying too far from our framework

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap = "Our app framework"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/excalidraw_framework.png")


```

Once we had the "MVP" version of the app, we then prioritised polishing each aspect, always referring back to the brief to make sure we were still working in the correct direction.
